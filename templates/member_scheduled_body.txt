Remember to be prepared for your appointment!

To complete a badge checkout, you must have the badge listed as pending on your profile (https://www.makehaven.org/user) – if it’s not there, be sure to go to the tool page, learn from the complete video, and take the quiz. You must get 100% on the quiz, so retake if you have errors.

We recommend reviewing the video with 24 hours of your appointment to be sure you are ready to go.
